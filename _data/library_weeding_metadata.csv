coll014,coll014_ weeding_without_worry_american_libraries_magazine.pdf,Weeding Without Worry:Transparency and communication help ease weeding woes,"Vnuk, Rebecca",2016-05-02,"The article Weeding without Worry by Rebecca Vnuk, published in American Libraries Magazine, discusses the often controversial practice of library weeding which includes systematic removal of outdated, damaged, or underutilized materials from a library’s collection. The article highlights past incidents where poorly managed weeding led to public backlash and outlines best practices for a transparent and well-communicated weeding process. Vnuk emphasizes the importance of staff and patron engagement, clear communication, and strategic planning to ensure that weeding is understood as a necessary aspect of maintaining a relevant and accessible library collection. Her book, The Weeding Handbook is also referenced in the article.

Understanding that no single approach fits all libraries, CREW: A Weeding Manual for Modern Libraries offers flexible guidelines, enabling librarians to adapt weeding practices to their specific community needs. It highlights the necessity of professional judgment and careful decision-making, even when faced with budget limitations. While adjustments to weeding criteria may be required, the manual reinforces that financial constraints should not justify keeping outdated or damaged materials, as regular weeding strengthens the overall quality and relevance of the collection.",discarding; weeding; libraries; discarding libraries; weeding libraries; weeding methods; weeding guidelines,methods; guidelines,Text,application/pdf,eng,"Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works
